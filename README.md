#DLIB-KNN Image Recognition

DLIB-KNN Image Recognition is a straightforward image recognition project that combines the DLIB library for face detection with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for image classification. This project focuses on recognizing images based on their content, making it a versatile solution for various image recognition tasks.

#Features:

DLIB Face Detection: Utilizes DLIB's powerful face detection capabilities to locate faces in images.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Uses the KNN algorithm as a classifier to recognize images based on their features.
Image Preprocessing: Provides tools for image cleaning and preprocessing, including thresholding and conversion to black and white (B/W).
